Inventors are consistently at the forefront of business but historically have trouble accruing value. Unique business models often use a new technology to unlock value that was previously constrained. Unfortunately, the business models usually constrain themselves by not being open to new inventions and the subsequent search for an alternative model. No wonder many of important businesses over time end up fading away after a few decades. However, as long as these businesses make the transition from creativity to efficiency then new models can emerge to fill the emerging niches. In the complex dynamics of business, inventors always have a place at the upper echelons of society and in particular, the potential to create a business model with various structural advantages that are near-impossible to replicate. As a result, inventions have a important role to play in not only creating businesses but keeping them relevant. Taking an invention to create a business is a complex task but history would show it is incredibly worthwhile and lucrative.

Throughout history, the modern inventor would be equivalent to the medieval wizard or the Babylonian priest. When done correctly, a business emerging from an invention creates a new religion. They meet higher levels of need: truth, community, models. This is driven by the observation that older ideas have a higher level of trust than newer ones. For example, all-in-all the bible has more wisdom than the latest self-help book. Even though an invention is new, what emerges from it (i.e. business, values, social structure) is likely old. A new product allows a business to emerge that fulfills an ancient need (i.e. seven deadly sins). The design process for a new business model is unlike that of new technology. A technology creates discontinuities whereas a unique business model create new personal truths that are difficult to replicate.

A business model is centered on valuable tasks. There is a perpetual emergence of new problems often coming from the invention/business model itself. Technology is a tradeoff between positive and negative consequences. The coal plant has given us electricity but polluted the air. The Internet has connected the world but reduced trust. The corn fields have fed the world but dried up the ground. From Henry David Thoreau: “[All our inventions are] but improved means to an unimproved end.” As a result, any business model needs explicit design to maximize the benefits of an invention while doing everything to mitigate downsides. History would suggest new technologies have driven economic growth, but also could play a role in growing inequality in our society. Simply, data would show that the ability to generate new wealth and distribute fairly ought to grow the number of inventors thereby generating even more wealth for more people. Ultimately, the inventor should be put on top of the societal stack where every policy is meant to maximize the potential of each individual.

There is accelerating change but the problems are no more complex to solve than they were centuries ago. The invention of steel brought on new products unimagined but created the machines of war that WWI and WWII were built upon. The personal computer and Internet themselves brought high levels of progress for companies and individuals while at the same time being used to intrude into the lives of entire populations and making people equivalent to numerical objects. Really, new inventions and models are created to solve these new problems. Despite the incredible bearishness on the US since its beginnings has been partly overcome by creativity accepted represented by the inventors punching above their weight in the country. At any given frame of time, technology may seem like the creator of societal problems but new inventions are inextricably linked to their solutions.
